# To-Do-List
# To-Do List Web Application

A simple and clean **To-Do List** web application that allows users to add, mark, and delete tasks. The app uses **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to create a smooth user experience. The tasks are stored in **localStorage** so that they persist even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- **Add tasks**: Users can input new tasks and add them to the list.
- **Mark tasks as complete**: Users can click on tasks to toggle their completion status.
- **Delete tasks**: Users can remove tasks from the list.
- **Persistent tasks**: Tasks are saved in `localStorage` and remain after a page refresh.
- **Responsive design**: The app is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
